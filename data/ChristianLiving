# Christian Living — WELS-Aligned Summary

## Marriage & Sexuality
- Marriage is God’s **lifelong union of one man and one woman**. Sexual intimacy is God’s gift **within marriage**; outside of marriage, God calls all to chastity.  
- We speak **truth in love**, showing dignity and compassion while teaching what Scripture says.

## Sanctity of Human Life
- Human life is God’s gift; the Fifth Commandment forbids taking innocent life.  
- WELS opposes elective abortion; difficult medical cases aim to preserve **all** human life as far as possible, seeking pastoral counsel.

## Vocation
- God calls Christians to serve him by serving others in daily callings (family, work, community, church). Ordinary work, done in faith and love, honors God.

## Stewardship
- God owns everything; we are **stewards** of time, abilities, and resources. Stewardship is whole-life gratitude, not merely money.

## Pastoral Care
- Because situations vary, members are encouraged to seek pastoral guidance for conscience questions, temptations, and complex circumstances.
