# Last Things â€” WELS-Aligned Summary

## Christ Will Return
- Jesus will **return visibly** to judge the living and the dead. No one knows the day or hour.

## Resurrection & Judgment
- The dead will be **raised**; believers to life with Christ, unbelievers to judgment. Judgment reveals faith/unbelief as shown in life.

## No Speculation
- We reject date-setting and end-times speculation. The church watches, prays, and lives faithfully in hope.

## Comfort for Believers
- Because Jesus conquered death, Christians face death with confidence and encourage one another with the promise of **resurrection**.
