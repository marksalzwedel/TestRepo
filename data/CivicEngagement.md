# Civic Engagement — WELS-Aligned Principles

## Prayer & Respect for Authorities
- Pray “for kings and all those in authority” (1 Tim 2:1–2); show proper respect (Rom 13).
- Christians may disagree with leaders and still speak with honor.

## The Church’s Public Stance
- WELS does **not** endorse/oppose specific candidates or parties.
- Pastors and congregations encourage informed, conscientious citizenship.

## Christian Freedom & Conscience
- Where Scripture doesn’t name a specific candidate, believers act in **Christian freedom** (Gal 5:1).
- Decisions are made with a **Scripture-shaped conscience**, not party loyalty.

## Weighing Character & Policy
- Consider both: truthfulness, integrity, and public conduct **and** policies touching life, justice, care for the vulnerable, and freedom to proclaim the gospel (Micah 6:8; Prov 31:8–9).
- Support what promotes the neighbor’s good and protects life.

## When Christians Differ
- Treat this as an **adiaphoron** when Scripture isn’t explicit.
- Practice mutual charity (Rom 14:1–13) and speak the truth in love (Eph 4:15).

## A Simple Discernment Checklist
- Have I prayed for all candidates and for our community? (1 Tim 2:1–2)
- Have I compared platforms re: life, justice, common good, gospel freedom? (Mic 6:8; Prov 31:8–9)
- Does the candidate’s pattern commend what is noble and true? (Phil 4:8)
- Can I vote with a **clear conscience** before God? (Rom 14:23)
- Will my stance help—not hinder—Christian witness? (1 Cor 10:23–33)
