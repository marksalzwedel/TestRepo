# Justification — WELS-Aligned Summary

## The Heart of the Gospel
- **Justification**: God declares sinners righteous **for Christ’s sake**. This is the central teaching of Scripture.

## Objective & Personal
- **Objective**: In Christ, God reconciled the world to himself; the gospel announces this finished work.  
- **Personal**: The benefits are received **through faith**—trusting Christ alone, not our works.

## Faith’s Role
- Faith is not a human achievement; the **Holy Spirit** creates and sustains faith through the gospel.

## Comfort for Consciences
- Our standing with God rests on Christ’s righteousness, not our performance. Assurance flows from God’s promises.
