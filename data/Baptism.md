# Holy Baptism — WELS-Aligned Summary

## What Baptism Is
- Baptism is a **means of grace**: God applies the gospel with water and his Word, giving forgiveness and new life.

## Who It’s For
- Baptism is for **all nations**, including **infants**, whom God also brings to faith. Parents and congregations nurture that faith with the Word.

## What It Gives
- Baptism saves (as Scripture teaches), unites us with Christ, and marks daily repentance and renewal for the baptized.

## Common Questions
- **Infant Baptism?** Yes—because all are born sinful and all need the gospel; the Spirit works faith through Baptism and the Word.  
- **“Just a symbol?”** No—Baptism is God’s action, delivering what he promises.
