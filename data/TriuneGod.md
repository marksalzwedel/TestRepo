# The Triune God — WELS-Aligned Summary

## One God, Three Persons
- There is **one God** in **three persons**—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—equal in power and glory, as revealed in Scripture.

## Mystery We Confess
- “Trinity” names a biblical reality we cannot fully explain; we confess it because **Scripture teaches it**, not because reason can resolve it.

## The Persons & Their Works
- Father: Creator and preserver.  
- Son: Redeemer who became truly human to save us.  
- Holy Spirit: Brings people to faith and sanctifies.  
> All three persons act in creation, redemption, and sanctification; Scripture sometimes highlights one person’s work to teach us.

## Why It Matters
- The Triune God is the one we worship, the one who saves us in Christ, and the one who dwells with believers by the Spirit.
