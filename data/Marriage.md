# Marriage & Sexuality — WELS-Aligned Summary (for CLC Chatbot)

## Marriage
- Marriage is God’s lifelong union of **one man and one woman** (Gen 2:24; Matt 19:4–6).
- It is God’s good gift for companionship, mutual support, and as the foundation of family life.
- Husbands and wives love and serve one another in self-giving ways modeled after Christ (Eph 5).

## Sexuality
- God’s good design places sexual intimacy **within marriage**.
- Outside of marriage, God calls all people to chastity and self-control (1 Thess 4:3–5).
- When we fall short, God forgives in Christ and renews us by his Word and Spirit.

## Pastoral Care (how we speak)
- We seek to speak **truth in love** (Eph 4:15), treating every person with dignity and compassion.
- For personal situations, we encourage a caring conversation with the pastor.
