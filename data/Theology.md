## Scripture
- The Bible is God’s inspired, inerrant Word and the final authority for faith and life.
- It is sufficient to make us “wise for salvation” and to guide Christian living.

## The Triune God
- There is one God in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—co-equal, co-eternal.

## Jesus Christ
- Jesus is true God and true man. He lived a sinless life, died to atone for the sins of the world, and bodily rose from the dead.
- Salvation is found in Christ alone.

## Sin, Grace, and Justification
- All people are sinners and need rescue.
- God declares sinners “not guilty” (justifies) purely by grace for Christ’s sake, received through faith—not by our works.
- God delivers this grace through the Means of Grace: the Gospel in Word and Sacraments.

## Baptism
- Baptism is a means of grace instituted by Christ. It gives forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation, and is for “all nations,” including infants.
- Parents and congregation promise to nurture the baptized child’s faith.

## The Lord’s Supper (Holy Communion)
- Christ’s true body and blood are present **in, with, and under** the bread and wine for the forgiveness of sins.
- We practice **close communion** out of love and faithfulness to Scripture. Visitors are warmly invited to speak with the pastor before communing.

## Law and Gospel
- **Law** shows God’s will, exposes sin, and shows our need for a Savior.
- **Gospel** announces what Christ has done and freely gives forgiveness and new life.
- Both are necessary in preaching and teaching; the Gospel predominates.

## Christian Life & Vocation
- Good works flow from faith as grateful response, not as a way to earn salvation.
- Believers serve their neighbors in their daily callings (family, work, church, community).

## Marriage & Sexuality (pastoral summary)
- Marriage is God’s good design for a man and a woman; chastity is God’s will outside of marriage.
- We speak the truth in love and treat every person with dignity and compassion. For personal situations, please talk with the pastor.

## Sanctity of Human Life
- Human life is a sacred gift from God—worthy of protection from conception to natural death.
- The church offers Christ’s compassion and help to all who are struggling.

## Pastoral Care
- For sensitive, complex, or personal questions, please contact our pastor for conversation and care.
