# Holy Communion — Theology (WELS-Aligned Summary)

> A concise doctrinal summary on the Lord’s Supper, drawn from WELS teaching and FAQs, formatted for chatbot synthesis.

## Real Presence
- WELS affirms Christ’s true body and blood are present "in, with, and under" the bread and wine (1 Corinthians 10:16; Matthew 26:26-28). It is not symbolic or merely spiritual.  
- This presence occurs by Christ’s words of institution—not by any human action—and brings forgiveness and assurance of faith.

## Rejection of Transubstantiation (and Symbolism Only)
- WELS rejects transubstantiation, which claims the bread and wine cease to be. Instead, Christ’s presence and the elements remain together.  
- The Sacrament is not merely symbolic—as in a memorial—but a means of grace where forgiveness is received.

## Receiving Worthily
- Unbelievers also receive Christ's body and blood—but to their judgment (1 Corinthians 11:29).  
- WELS stresses the seriousness of self-examination before communing.

## Frequency & “As Often as”
- The Bible encourages frequent reception (“whenever you eat…”; 1 Corinthians 11:26).  
- Ultimately, the frequency is determined by each congregation in Christian freedom.

## Closed (Close) Communion & Unity
- WELS practices close communion to maintain doctrinal unity. Participating expresses shared faith in Christ, and it follows Scripture’s call for unity in 1 Corinthians 10:17.  

## Summary & Application
- **Holy Communion** is a means of grace where Jesus is truly present and offers forgiveness, life, and salvation to repentant believers.  
- It is central to worship, rightly received through faith, and practiced in a way that reflects unity of confession.  
- For personal questions or guidance, your pastors are available to speak with you.
