# Christ & Redemption — WELS-Aligned Summary

## Who Jesus Is
- Jesus Christ is **true God and true man**. Conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary, he is God’s Son in the flesh.

## What He Did
- Jesus fulfilled God’s law perfectly and **bore our sins** as our substitute, dying on the cross and rising bodily from the dead.  
- By his **once-for-all** sacrifice and resurrection, he redeemed the world and conquered death.

## What This Means
- God **justifies** sinners for Christ’s sake—declares us righteous—apart from our works.  
- Salvation is received **by faith** (trust in Christ), which the Holy Spirit creates through the gospel.

## Our Hope
- The risen and ascended Lord reigns over all things and will return in glory. Believers live in forgiveness now and await the resurrection.
