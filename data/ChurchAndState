# Church & State — WELS-Aligned Summary

## Two Realms from God
- God institutes both **church** and **state**; the state’s mandate is civil order and justice, the church’s mandate is the gospel.

## Obedience & Conscience
- Christians obey governing authorities **for conscience’s sake**, **unless** commanded to sin—then we must obey God rather than men.

## Public Witness
- Believers practice responsible citizenship and pray for leaders, while the church avoids partisan endorsements, focusing on Christ’s mission.
