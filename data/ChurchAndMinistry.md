# Church & Ministry — WELS-Aligned Summary

## The Church
- The **holy Christian Church** is all believers in Christ; it is invisible to human eyes and found wherever the gospel is proclaimed.

## The Ministry
- Christ instituted the **ministry of the gospel**—the public service of Word and Sacrament.  
- The keys (forgiveness/retention) belong to the whole church and are exercised publicly through called workers.

## Local Congregations
- Visible congregations gather around Word and Sacrament; because of sin, they may include hypocrites.  
- We practice church **fellowship** with those united in confession.
