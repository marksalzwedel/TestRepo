# Law & Gospel — WELS-Aligned Summary

## Two Words from God
- **Law** shows God’s holy will, exposes sin, and condemns.  
- **Gospel** announces Christ’s completed work and freely **forgives** sinners.

## Not Contradictory, But Distinct
- Law and gospel serve different purposes; mixing them confuses consciences. Proper distinction gives both **clarity** and **comfort**.

## In Preaching & Care
- The church preaches both: law to reveal need, gospel to give Christ.  
- Pastoral application aims for repentance, faith, and a life of love.

## Daily Christian Life
- Christians still need the law’s guidance (third use) and the gospel’s power; the Spirit produces good works in those justified by faith.
