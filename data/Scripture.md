# Scripture — WELS-Aligned Summary

## What Scripture Is
- The Bible is **God’s Word**, given to make us “wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.” It is inspired, inerrant, and infallible.  
- Scripture is the **only** and **all-sufficient** source and norm for Christian faith and life.

## Authority & Sufficiency
- Because it is God’s Word, Scripture is our **final authority** on doctrine and ethics.  
- Nothing may be added to or taken from it; all teachings must be tested by it.

## What Scripture Does
- The Holy Spirit uses the gospel in the **Word** (and the Sacraments) to create and strengthen faith—this is part of the “means of grace.”

## How We Read It
- Christ is the center of Scripture; the **law** shows sin and the **gospel** shows the Savior.  
- We interpret unclear passages in light of clear ones, receiving the text in its historical and literary context.
